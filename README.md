# ywit_2020_cad_workshop
Files created during the CAD for 3D Printing workshop.

## .f3d File
The .f3d file is a Fusion 360 file. You can open this file in Fusion 360 and edit all of the pieces and components just like we did during the workshop.

## .stl Files
The .stl files are exported from each piece of our .f3d file that we want to send to our 3D printer.
